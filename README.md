FSpec
=====

A hack of a gherkin implemetation attempt, using built-in F# syntax instead of a separate language.  Functional principles
are followed, such as `When` statements not being allowed to affect the state of the run. 

See some example features in `Features.fs` and their step definitions in `StepDefs.fs`
